# 🚀 JavaProjects by Hemanth Bezawada

Welcome to my curated collection of Java-based projects — a personal initiative to learn by building. Instead of spending hours stuck in tutorials, I believe in *learning by doing*, tackling problems hands-on, and pushing my understanding of Java, one project at a time.

This repository isn't just a bunch of code — it's my **growth log**, my **code journal**, and my **proof of progress** as I aim to become a well-rounded developer and tech problem-solver.

## 🔍 Why This Repo Exists

As a B.E. student passionate about software development, I wanted to:
- Strengthen my **core Java concepts** through real implementation.
- Build a solid **portfolio** to showcase my problem-solving and OOP skills.
- Practice writing code that is not only functional but **clean, modular, and readable**.
- Create a space that reflects my mindset: **Iterate. Improve. Deliver.**

---

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project folder typically includes:
- `Main.java` or multiple source files under `/src`
- `README.md` explaining the objective, logic, and output
- `notes.txt` (optional) for personal insights or alternative approaches
- Screenshots or sample outputs if relevant

---

## 🧠 What I'm Learning Along the Way

- Java Fundamentals: variables, loops, conditionals, arrays
- Object-Oriented Programming: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- Java Collections: ArrayList, HashMap, Set
- File Handling: reading/writing from/to `.txt` files
- Java GUI (Swing): event listeners, layout management
- Writing cleaner, reusable, and modular code
- Debugging and testing on my own
- Version control using Git and GitHub

## ✨ Highlights (Coming Soon)

> I'll be tagging some projects as *Highlighted* once they meet these criteria:
- Built with clean OOP structure ✅
- Uses real-world logic or problem-solving ✅
- Fully documented and presentable ✅

## 🧩 Future Plans

Once the core 10-project ladder is complete, I plan to:
- Start exploring **JavaFX** or **Spring Boot** for web-based apps
- Build REST APIs using Java
- Collaborate with others on small open-source Java tools
- Rebuild some of these projects with **advanced patterns** and **testing**
